                <h5 class="text-capitalize text-success text-left">I had visited this in February 2019</h5>
                <p class="text-muted text-left"> Since bastian was trending all over Insta and I had been to the Bandra one, decided to go here! And let me admit it’s an experience!! We were trying to book it for the valentine day but it was packed. But we finally got through and the thing is they only do dinners that also are in slots so you really got to choose your time and go accordingly. As soon as you enter it’s this huge white place which looks almost another city in Mumbai. It’s very nicely done and it gives you like a comforting vibe. The food is phenomenal and the prices I would say is decently kept because for the ambience and the food it’s all worth. Also they have kinda open kitchen so you can pretty much have a look at how busy it gets but all in all the service is also pretty nice. If you wanna have a fancy dinner with your girl pals or family you should definitely give this place a visit.
                    P.s. it’s owned by Shilpa Shetty and you can expect some more celebs hanging out there too. </p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left"> Its not the first time that I have been here. But this restaurant is a class act. The ambiance is so comfortable and luxurious. The staff, so efficient and so pleasant and so attentive to all your needs. However crowded the restaurant its still does not seem claustrophobic. The smile on the faces of the team never fades.The food is absolutely out of the world. We were 12 of us and I dont think there was one dish that was not delicious. It was indeed a pleasant surprise too with the Bill. It was far more economical than I expected. </p>

                <p> Overall this show is really good. It introduces children to a variety of foods by exploring where they come from, how they're harvested, and how different cultures use them. Even though my 3 year old enjoys it, the humor and concepts are a little over her head. I'd say it's best for at least 4 or 5 year olds. I will mention that the potato episode refers to the potato as "ugly" numerous times in the beginning, and in the egg episode, Waffles says a chicken has a "big butt"; we don't like using those types of words or phrasing in our house, but every home is different, so that may not be an issue for you. Additionally, the catch phrase is "listen to your vegetables and eat your parents", which is silly, but also kinda weird. </p>

                The food industry is at a crossroads. The United Nations projects worldwide food supply needs to increase by 50% in coming years to accommodate population growth. At the same time, food industry players are trying to become carbon neutral, and climate change is putting vast swaths of terrain used for crops and livestock at risk. “You can think about, ‘How do we make the food system lower carbon?’ Or you can think about, ‘How do we feed an extra two billion people?’,” says Jessica Alsford, Morgan Stanley’s head of global sustainability research. <a class="article" href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/future-returns-investing-in-the-evolving-food-industry-01616524975" target="_blank">Read more...</a> </p>

The 2017 NotPetya supply-chain wiper attack hit $26.6 billion global food company Mondelez International hard, sidelining Windows-based computers and disrupting its distribution. Sure, APT attacks can be destructive and even deadly, but denying the world their Oreo cookies is just plain cruel. Indeed, Nikolay Betov, information security officer at Mondelez, told SC media that this event “changed everything.” <a class="article" href="https://www.scmagazine.com/security-training-certification-user-awareness/no-more-snack-attacks-mondelez-hopes-new-security-training-program-can-help-prevent-the-next-notpetya/" target="_blank">Read more...</a> </p>

                    <p class="p_modal">“Cooking shouldn’t just be about making a delicious dish—owning the process and enjoying the experience ought to be just as important as the meal itself. The new Joy of Cooking is a reminder that nothing can compare to gathering around the table for a home cooked meal with the people who matter most.” —Joanna Gaines, author of The Magnolia Table “Generation after generation, Joy has been a warm, encouraging presence in American kitchens, teaching us to cook with grace and humor. This luminous new edition continues on that important tradition while seamlessly weaving in modern touches, making it all the more indispensable for generations to come.” —Samin Nosrat, author of Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat. In the nearly ninety years since Irma S. Rombauer self-published the first three thousand copies of Joy of Cooking in 1931, it has become the kitchen bible, with more than 20 million copies in print. This new edition of Joy has been thoroughly revised and expanded by Irma’s great-grandson John Becker and his wife, Megan Scott. John and Megan developed more than six hundred new recipes for this edition, tested and tweaked thousands of classic recipes and updated every section of every chapter to reflect the latest ingredients and techniques available to today’s home cooks. Their strategy for revising this edition was the same one Irma and Marion employed: Vet, research and improve Joy’s coverage of legacy recipes while introducing new dishes, modern cooking techniques and comprehensive information on ingredients now available at farmers’ markets and grocery stores. You will find tried-and-true favorites like Banana Bread Cockaigne, Chocolate Chip Cookies and Southern Corn Bread—all retested and faithfully improved—as well as new favorites like Chana Masala, Beef Rendang, Megan’s Seeded Olive Oil Granola and Smoked Pork Shoulder. In addition to a thoroughly modernized vegetable chapter, there are many more vegan and vegetarian recipes, including Caramelized Tamarind Tempeh, Crispy Pan-Fried Tofu, Spicy Chickpea Soup and Roasted Mushroom Burgers. Joy’s baking chapters now include gram weights for accuracy, along with a refreshed line-up of baked goods like Cannelés de Bordeaux, Rustic No-Knead Sourdough, Ciabatta, Chocolate-Walnut Babka and Chicago-Style Deep-Dish Pizza, as well as gluten-free recipes for pizza dough and yeast breads. A new chapter on streamlined cooking explains how to economize time, money and ingredients and avoid waste. You will learn how to use a diverse array of ingredients, from amaranth to za’atar. New techniques include low-temperature and sous vide cooking, fermentation and cooking with both traditional and electric pressure cookers. Barbecuing, smoking and other outdoor cooking methods are covered in even greater detail. This new edition of Joy is the perfect combination of classic recipes, new dishes and indispensable reference information for today’s home cooks. Whether it is the only cookbook on your shelf or one of many, Joy is and has been the essential and trusted guide for home cooks for almost a century. This new edition continues that legacy. <br>

                    <p class="p_modal">Magnolia Table is infused with Joanna Gaines’ warmth and passion for all things family, prepared and served straight from the heart of her home, with recipes inspired by dozens of Gaines family favourites and classic comfort selections from the couple’s new Waco restaurant, Magnolia Table, which opens early 2018. Jo believes there’s no better way to celebrate family and friendship than through the art of togetherness, celebrating tradition and sharing a great meal. Magnolia Table includes 125 classic recipes from breakfast, lunch and dinner to small plates, snacks and desserts presenting a modern selection of American classics and personal family favourites. Complemented by her love for her garden, these dishes also incorporate home-grown, seasonal produce at the peak of its flavour. Inside Magnolia Table, you’ll find recipes the whole family will enjoy, such as: Chicken Pot Pie, Chocolate Chip Cookies, Asparagus and Fontina Quiche and so much more! Full of personal stories and beautiful photos, Magnolia Table is an invitation to share a seat at the table with Joanna Gaines and her family. <br>
